Project 1: Linear Regression

Implemented a linear regression algorithm using NumPy and pandas to learn and predict house prices.

Project 2: Decision Trees

Developed a Python decision tree classifier with support for entropy, Gini impurity, gain ratio, depth pruning, and chi-squared pruning.

Project 3: Classification Algorithms

Implemented classifiers including Naive Bayes, MAP, MaxPrior, and MaxLikelihood.

Project 4: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

Implemented logistic regression with gradient descent, Naive Bayes using EM for Gaussian mixtures, and feature selection via Pearson correlation.

Project 5: K-Means Clustering

Implemented K-Means and K-Means++ clustering algorithms for color quantization of images.
